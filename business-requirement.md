# Business requirement of the Job Request System

Please create a React page for an online job request submission system. The left section of the page should show a list of requested jobs. Available job items in the job list are: Dog Walk (30 min), Dog Wash (1 hr), Dog Daycare (4 hr morning), Dog Daycare (4 hr afternoon), Dog Daycare (8 hr), HAVC repair (2 hr), and Grocery Shopping (2 hr). On the right section of the page, the user can request for a job by clicking on a "New Job Request" button, which pop up a job request form. In the job request form, the user selects a job item from the job list, select the date from a calendar, enter the location in the location text box, enter the details of the job in another text box, and then click on the "Submit Job Request" button to submit the new job request. This new job request is then added into the requested job list in the left section of the page. Attached is the mockup image of the right section. Please use the color scheme from the image to style the page. Please make the right section hidden by default and add a button to show and hide the right section with animation.
